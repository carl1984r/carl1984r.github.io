  Working on producing this app so far has been fun!  At this point, the controllers and views are mostly complete.  There are a few refinements to go... but I also know that meeting the project requirements matters the most.  I feel my familiarity with all the technologies behind the production of this app has definitely been expanded.

  All that remains is to produce a tutorial video, touch up a few things on the app and update the spec file within the app repository.  I feel accomplished so far.   I've noticed that searching for pertinent information about general programming questions has improved since the start of the curriculum - also the Flatiron Tech Coaches have been great!
