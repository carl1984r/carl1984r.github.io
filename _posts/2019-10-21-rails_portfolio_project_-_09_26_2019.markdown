The process of building this project over the last month has been very enjoyable and educational.  As I work on the project, I often formulate better ways to refactor code.  Most of these ideas manifest when I'm taking a break from the project.   Working on this project in multiple small amounts of time throughout the day seems to benefit problem solving for myself.  Producing this project with Rails has definitely shown a higher level of complexity - adding a level of excitement for myself.  Along with the complexity comes the benefit of tons of extra benefits provided by the Rails environment.  A part of me wants to add much more styling and features to the app - but I need to keep it simple and get it ready for submission  :)
