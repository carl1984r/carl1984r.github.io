Ever since I was young, I had an interest in how a computer works - especially when I spent time fixing my first computer (with a well-known operating system).  The purpose of my first computer was to be able to complete any school related research from home and print any documents needed for school.  Unfortunately, the platform I was working with was not incredibly reliable - at all.  This led me to naturally find solutions to improve what I was working with.  Over time, I did find solutions but through a lot of trial and error - both hardware and software.

Fast forward to 2018 - up to this point - I had a mild interest in software development but never got around to seriously starting any curriculum.  Hurricane Michael passed through where I live during that year - completely disrupting our family and everyone within the surrounding counties.  Hurricanes were not anything new to my experience in Florida - however this hurricane  was massively destructive.  We lost our home - our families leaving nearby also sustained major damage.  Employers were destroyed - infrastructure as well.  

I needed a change - a challenge...  The internet returned about 2 months later.  I was motivated.  I began to research what my options were for software development - online.  I found it at Flatiron!
