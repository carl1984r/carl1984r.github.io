The JS Portfolio Project has been truly enjoyable.  The pace of working on this project has been slower due to a busy schedule - but what matters is that I complete a little each day.  I've never worked with with Javascript before and quickly began to see common patterns similar with other languages I've been exposed to so far.  I stuck with simplicity when coming up with ideas for this project (and all the other projects within Flatiron).  Once I get the initial idea of what I want to achieve, I listed the main goals I want the project to accomplish.  The most important goals of course is meeting the project requirements.  If time permits - I will add a few more to make my project a bit more polished.  

Working with javascript revealed similar components noted within Ruby, CSS and HTML.  Getting used to the syntax of Javascript (and all other languages) is a matter of practice.  The more time invested - the more ease of working with the language.  Javascript directly manipulates the DOM - which allows for really awesome page manipulation without reloading the page.  

Project structure is composed of a frontend and backend.  The frontend for my project contains any HTML, CSS and the associated JS file(s).  The backend contains the Rails API .  The setup for the Rails API is relatively straightforward and has revealed more amazing capabilities contained within the Rails platform.
