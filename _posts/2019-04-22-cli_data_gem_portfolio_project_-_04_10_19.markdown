After reading the CLI project requirements, I felt motivated and well informed about what direction I needed to be moving.  One of my first goals was to set up a planning meeting to validate my idea for the project.  I set this a few days into the future - that way I could get a head start in discovering what classes my project will have and begin to frame how the project files will be able to communicate to each other.  If I need to make any changes - it would (hopefully) take a short amount of time.  

The videos located within the project requirements were very helpful to provide examples of a general way to approach setting up a new project.  I plan on working on this project in small intervals (about 30 minutes).  Taking breaks allows me to think about my next move with the project.
