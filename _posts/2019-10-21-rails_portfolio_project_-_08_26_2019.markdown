Starting this project required me to set up a local environment on my computer.  I was made aware of some of the options available for my machine - eventually I settled on the best performing setup available for my machine.  I first set up a new repository on github.  Once I linked my local environment to the repository, I began to add some of the required files for the project.  One of the first goals was to set up a root page and get it working.  Next was to set up some styling - simple with intent to make it reusable.  Rails appears to have a ton of options available and a lot of documentation to go with it!
