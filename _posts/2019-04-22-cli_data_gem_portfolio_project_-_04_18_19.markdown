On this day, the project planning meeting is scheduled.  I have completed enough of the project to be able to produce the instances I need from the CLI - that way during the meeting, I can detail what I intend to do with these instances.  The meeting goes well!  My idea sounds appropriate for the project and now it's time to finish it all up.  I know it will be a few more days to go, but that will pass in no time.  I feel accomplished thus far!
