At this time, the project is able to function with "fake data".  The planning meeting is about 4 days away, but I feel confident with what direction I want to be going.  If I need to make any changes - at least I got some practice in!  The next part I begin to work on is the scraper component of the project.   This part of the project is actually enjoyable to me - especially once Nokogiri is able to produce exactly what I need.  Once is discover the patterns of the website I am scraping - obtaining the remainder of the data I need becomes a bit simpler.  

The site I am scraping will ultimately be used to create instances to which I can work with later.  I dont feel incredibly pressured, but I would like to be able to produce instances containing the scraped data prior to the planning meeting.
