  When I began my Sinatra Portfolio project on July 12th of this month - I kept my initial ideas simple and open for change.  I needed to first set up a new repository on GitHub for the application.  Once I completed this,  I had to set up an environment for the application to communicate with all the necessary components of the application.  Setting this environment up using Sinatra was relatively quick and allowed me to progress into setting up the database for the app. 
	
  I began to work on the database as advised per the curriculum.  As I worked, I would often come up with new ideas or changes to add within the app.  Making these small changes and observing the results within the app made me feel excited and wanting to progress even more - but I also needed to balance working on an app with managing other aspects of my life.  So far, I've been working on the app in short intervals - I believe this has helped maximize my problem solving and propagation of new ideas.
