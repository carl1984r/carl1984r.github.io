  Progress on the app has been great!  After setting up the database for my app, I knew I needed to set up models within the app which created useful relationships to easily create, read, update and delete data for the app.  I discovered myself referencing the official documentation for ActiveRecord quite often.  Building these relationships also allowed me to discover the many pathways that are available for a developer.  

  Once my models + associations were completed, I began to work on the controllers and views of the app.  My app is in position to persist data and produce useful relationships for the data.  When working on the first controller, I began to work on the first set of views which applied to that particular controller.  At this point the views are simply functional - allowing me to populate with data and test the results.   I know that once I have produced the desired CRUD functions with one controller, it makes applying CRUD to other controllers a little simpler.
